            <p></p>
            Shrimp have a wide variety of preparation methods. A common one is to butterfly them. This lays the meat flat while still keeping it intact. Different methods of cooking the shrimp include grilling, frying, baking, and more.

            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 
                <li>Spread the bread crumbs evenly on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch them carefully as they burn very quickly. Remove from the oven and cool. Raise the oven to 500 degrees F. </li>
                <li>Butterfly the shrimp by slicing from the tail to the front on the top of the shrimp, where the vein was. Slice as deep as possible without cutting all the way through. Turn the shrimp over and make 3 small shallow slits horizontally across the shrimp, being careful not to cut all the way through. These slits will prevent the shrimp from curling during cooking. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. </li>
                <li>Mix together the oregano, thyme, parsley, basil and garlic. Add the garlic herb mixture to the bread crumbs and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
                <li>Brush a large ovenproof skillet with some of the melted butter, coating the bottom well. Dip the shrimp in the butter, opened side down, and then dredge in the bread crumbs, pressing so they stick. Place the shrimp, bread crumb side up, in the skillet in 1 layer. </li>
                <li>When all of the shrimp are in the pan, drizzle the top with a little more of the melted butter. Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are just cooked through and the bread crumbs are golden brown. </li>
                <li>Toss the arugula with the olive oil and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Divide the arugula among 4 plates. Place 4 shrimp around each pile of arugula. Drizzle with more butter, if desired, and serve with lemon wedges. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Combine the paprika and oregano in a small bowl. Rub the spice mix all over the chicken and marinate chicken for 1 hour in the refrigerator.  </li>
                <li>Heat oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat. Saute the chorizo until browned, remove and reserve. Add chicken skin-side down and brown on all sides, turning with tongs. Add salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove from pan and reserve.  </li>
                <li>In the same pan, make a sofrito by sauteing the onions, garlic, and parsley. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes on a medium heat. Then, add tomatoes and cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld. Fold in the rice and stir-fry to coat the grains. Pour in water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the liquid. Add chicken, chorizo, and saffron. Add the clams and shrimp, tucking them into the rice. The shrimp will take about 8 minutes to cook. Give the paella a good shake and let it simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente, for about 15 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, when the rice is filling the pan, add the lobster tails. When the paella is cooked and the rice looks fluffy and moist, turn the heat up for 40 seconds until you can smell the rice toast at the bottom, then it's perfect.  </li>
                <li>Remove from heat and rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with peas, parsley and lemon wedges. </li>

                <li>Soak the dried shitake for at least 2 hours in luke warm water.</li>
                <li>Remove the stems from the mushroom and clean</li>
                <li>Place the mushrooms in a small pot with the ½ cup of Abalone liquid from the first part along with another ½ cup of chicken stock and bring to a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes. During the final 2 minutes throw in the carrot slices.</li>
                <li>Clean the Bok Choy and separate the leaves into individual pieces.</li>
                <li>In a heated wok add a couple tablespoon of oil, salt and ½ cup of water then throw in the bok choy and stir for about 2 minutes under high heat. The bok choy should still have good colour and still be a bit crunchy and not limp. Quickly poor out into a heat resistant strainer and allow to drain well.</li>
                <li>Now start assembling the dish for serving by placing the Bok Choy in centered pile and then distributing the mushrooms evenly over the top. Add the carrots strategically around the plate then do the same with the Abalone.</li>
                <li>Now prepare the sauce by heating the wok under medium high heat and add in the ½ cup Chicken Stock, remaining Mushroom and abalone sauce, the Oyster sauce and the soy sauce. Bring to a boil and make a cornstarch slurry by adding 1 tablespoon of corn starch with 3 tablespoon of water. Add this to the sauce and allow to thicken then add the Sesame oil and mix well then drizzle the sauce over the dish just until it is well covered. Serve hot for best results.</li>
