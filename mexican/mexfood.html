            <p></p>
            Aguas frescas translates to cool waters in Spanish. They’re a combination of fruits, cereals, flowers, and/or seeds blended with sugar and water. Flavors include tamarind, hibiscus, and horchatas. Although it is popular in Mexico, it isn’t uncommon to see them featured in Mexican restaurants in the US.

            <p></p>
            Barbacoa is a common food in northern and central Mexican cuisine. It can be made from beef head, goat meat, lamb, or pork. Its interpretation is loose so you can find variations slow-cooked over an open flame, steamed, or in a hole dug in the ground covered with maguey leaves.

        <span>Directions</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place the dried guajillo chiles into the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until the color changes and the chiles have puffed, about 5 minutes. Set the chiles aside to cool for a moment. Meanwhile, toast the cumin and cloves in the hot skillet until the cumin seeds begin to pop; remove from the pan and set aside. Remove and discard the stems, seeds, and veins of the chiles, and place into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over top, and cover. Let the chiles soak for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Grind the toasted cumin and cloves into a powder, and place into a blender. Add the ancho chile powder, onion, garlic, oregano, thyme, vinegar, and lime juice. Remove the chiles from the soaking water, and place into the blender along with 1/3 cup of the soaking liquid. Cover, and blend until a smooth paste forms.</li>
                <li>Place the beef roast into a mixing bowl, and pour the guajillo chile past over top. Coat the roast on all sides with the paste, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Transfer the roast and marinade to a roasting pan, and arrange the bay leaves over top. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender and is easily pulled apart with a fork, about 6 hours. Let stand, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour before discarding the bay leaves and shredding with two forks.</li>

            <p></p>
            Cotija is a common cheese in Mexico named after the town of Cotija, Michoacan. It is a hard cow’s milk cheese. It can come in a dry and firm version or a moister, fattier version. It is only produced during the months of July through October. Although it is almost impossible to produce at home, you can definitely do some research and try it in restaurants or purchase it in small rounds or blocks.

        <span>Directions</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Place pork into a Dutch oven with onion and garlic, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is cooked through, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from the chile pods. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat to cool. Transfer the chiles and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, stir in salt, and set aside. Shred the cooked meat and mix in one cup of the chile sauce.</li>
                <li>Soak the corn husks in a bowl of warm water. In a large bowl, beat the lard with a tablespoon of the broth until fluffy. Combine the masa harina, baking powder and salt; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as necessary to form a spongy dough.</li>
                <li>Spread the dough out over the corn husks to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place one tablespoon of the meat filling into the center. Fold the sides of the husks in toward the center and place in a steamer. Steam for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Remove tamales from husks and drizzle remaining chile sauce over. Top with sour cream. For a creamy sauce, mix sour cream into the chile sauce.</li>
            </ul>
