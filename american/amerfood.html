            <p class="title">Apple Pie</p>
            <p></p>
            Brought by the British, Dutch, and Swedes in the 17th and 18th centuries, apple pie has since become an American classic. Modern American apple pie includes a crust on the bottom, apple filling usually spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices, and a top crust that can vary. Traditional apple pies usually include a basic crust while other styles incorporate different crusts (Dutch apple pies can come with a crumb crust or a lattice style for example).

            The Buckeye candy, simply referred to as buckeyes, is a common sweet in Ohio and its surrounding states. Homemade buckeyes are common but are also easily purchasable. They consist of peanut butter balls dipped in chocolate. The peak of the candy leaves a small area of peanut butter uncovered, giving it its iconic appearance mimicking the buckeye nut.

            <p></p>
            Although the pizza debate is hotly contested between Chicago and New York, we will be focusing on Chicago-style deep dish pizza. New York will get its own dish further down. The pan in which the pizza is cooked in gives it a high edge and a depth that allows for a large amount of sauce and cheese. It can also be prepared as a stuffed pizza. Both versions give the appearance of a pie more than a pizza.

                <li>For the crust: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in a mixer. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. On low speed, beat the dough ingredients. Continuing on low speed, beat the dough until it is soft. </li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours. </li>
                <li>Lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside. Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and roll the dough into a large 15x12 rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the dough. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes. after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425F degrees.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle. Place over a 9x2 inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese, then your toppings. Pour about 1 and 1/4 cups of sauce on top of each. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove the pizzas from the oven and allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. </li>

            Kansas City-style barbeque is a regional style of barbeque that involves slowly smoked meat. It is usually smoked over a variety of woods and then covered in barbeque sauce. It can also include side dishes such as baked beans, French fries, and cole slaw. With so many different styles of barbeque, we decided to focus only on Kansas City-style and Texas-style (found below). Feel free to research other styles and try them for yourself as well.

Turn the rib racks bone-side-up and remove the thin membrane layer covering the ribs by lifting up a small corner with a paring knife and tugging it off. You can use a paper towel to secure your grip. Rub the spice mixture all over both racks. Place both racks, bone-side-up, on a baking sheet lined with foil. Cover with foil and put in the oven. The meat should be tender enough to easily insert your knife into the ribs after 1 1/2 hours.  </li>
                <li>As the ribs cook, make your BBQ sauce. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, chili powder, paprika, red pepper, allspice and cloves and cook, stirring, until the paste is dark brick red, about 3 minutes. Add the ketchup, 2 cups water, vinegar, molasses, brown sugar, salt, soy sauce, Worcestershire, mustard, black pepper and bay leaf. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the flavors come together, about 30 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf before using. You should have about a quart of sauce. Set aside 1 1/2 cups of sauce for basting. Serve the remaining sauce on the side for dipping.  </li>
                <li>After the ribs have been in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, remove the foil cover and brush the ribs with BBQ sauce. Cook uncovered until the meat is fork tender and comes off the bone easily, another 1 1/2 hours. While the ribs cook, keep basting and flipping them every half hour. Serve with reserved BBQ sauce on the side. Keep any leftover BBQ sauce in your refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. </li>
