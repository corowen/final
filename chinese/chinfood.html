        <span>Directions</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Dissolve 1/4 cup sugar in 1 3/4 cups warm water, and then add the yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes, or until mixture is frothy. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons shortening and the yeast mixture; mix well.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, and cover it with a sheet of cling wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until it has tripled in bulk.</li>
                <li>Cut the pork into 2 inch thick strips. Use fork to prick it all over. Marinate for 5 hours in a mixture made with 1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, and 1 teaspoon sweet soy sauce. Grill the pork until cooked and charred. Cut roasted port into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, oyster sauce, and 1 cup water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil. Mix cornstarch with 2 1/2 tablespoons water; add to the saucepan, and stir until thickened. Mix in 2 tablespoons lard or shortening, sesame oil, and white pepper. Cool, and mix in the roasted pork.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the bowl, and knead it on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth and elastic. Roll the dough into a long roll, and divide it into 24 pieces. Flatten each piece with the palm of the hand to form a thin circle. The center of the circle should be thicker than the edge. Place one portion of the pork filling in the center of each dough circle. Wrap the dough to enclose the filling. Pinch edges to form the bun. Let the buns stand for 10 minutes.
                Steam buns for 12 minutes. Serve.</li>

            Beef tendon is a popular ingredient in many Asian cuisines. It is normally tough and hard to chew, but can become soft after a long period of cooking. Chinese style beef tendon is marinated in garlic and is very popular in dim sum restaurants.

            <ul>
                <li>5 pounds beef plate, cut into bite-size cubes</li>
                <li>1.5 pounds beef tendon, cut into bite-size cubes</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons Shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>6 dried chili peppers</li>
                <li>1 1/2 thumbnail ginger</li>
                <li>6 inches scallion</li>
                <li>4 bay leaves</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons salt</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="dir">
        <span>Directions</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Place beef tendon in a pressure cooker and add water to cover beef completely. Place on high heat until rated pressure has been reached. Turn to lowest heat. Simmer at rated pressure for 30 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.</li>
                <li>While simmering the beef tendon, prepare beef plate. Add beef plate into a large pot and add water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium-low heat and keep a gentle boil going for 10 to 15 minutes. While boiling, skim the foam from the top of the broth and discard it. Turn off heat. Use a colander to transfer beef to a wok (or a large dutch oven). Let the soup sit about 10 minutes, then pour the soup into the wok until it covers the beef completely. Save the rest of the soup in the pot and set it aside for later use.</li>
                <li>Heat the wok over medium heat. Add Shaoxing wine, chili pepper, ginger, scallion, bay leaves and black pepper into wok and simmer, covered, for about 40 minutes. The beef tendon should be ready at that point.</li>
                <li>Transfer beef tendon from the pressure cooker to the wok, and discard the broth.</li>
                <li>Add curry powder, sugar and tomato paste into wok and mix well. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, until beef starts to become more tender.</li>
                <li>Add dark soy sauce, light soy sauce and salt into the wok. Mix well and simmer, covered, for one hour to one hour and a half. </li>
                <li>While simmering, stir the beef several times. Scoop the beef from the bottom with a spatula, to avoid burning it on the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>After 20 minutes, watch the beef more closely and adjust the seasoning. If the liquid is becoming thick, but the beef is still tough, add more broth, half a cup at a time. The liquid should be able to cover half of the beef. However, do not add too much water at the end of simmering, when beef is already soft.</li>
                <li>When simmering has finished, adjust the seasoning again. The beef should be very tender and the soup quite thick. If the soup is not thick enough, boil uncovered over medium heat. Stand near the wok and stir constantly until soup thickens.</li>
                <li>Serve warm with steamed rice.</li>

                <p></p>
                Dim sum is commonly served during yum cha (drink tea). It is defined as small portions of food served in small steamer baskets or small plates. It can be ordered or brought around in carts to be ordered from. It can range from meats, dumplings, and many, many other varieties of dishes. It is also served with tea. Since there are so many different varieties of dim sum, you’ll have to do research on what type of dim sum you want to prepare or order at restaurants.

            Fried tofu is common in East and Southeast Asia. It involves deep frying tofu in some sort of oil. Since there are different types of tofu (firm, soft, medium), it can come out differently depending on the type of tofu. In Chinese cuisine, it is served with garlic soy sauce.

                <li>1/2 cup Chinese rock sugar</li>

        <div class="dir">
        <span>Directions</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Start by gathering your ingredients. It’s a short list! Just red adzuki beans, Chinese rock sugar, tapioca pearls and an orange (if you like).
                Soak the red beans in cold water for 3 hours.
                Discard the soaking water, then put the beans in a medium pot and cover with 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
                After 1 hour, the beans should start to “look and feel right,” that is, they should be breaking down, but still somewhat firm. At this stage, the soup looks done, but you’ll notice it doesn’t taste right — there’s no sweetness to the beans themselves.
                Remove 1 cup of soup and blend with a hand blender, then return the blended soup to the main pot.
                Add the rock sugar and orange zest, then stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the tapioca pearls and cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the tapioca pearls are translucent.
                During the last phase of simmering, add up to 1 cup of additional water to achieve your desired consistency. Serve immediately.</li>
